\section{Introduction}
	\IEEEPARstart{V}{irtual} commissioning is gaining relevance in many industries due to its advantages. However, the creation and especially the integration of models of the different components is a hurdle. A unified data structure consisting of the geometry, behavior and exemplary automation code can reduce this hurdle. \\
	Aim of this thesis is to extend an existing learning factory and create a concept where component libraries including simulation models, kinematized visualizations and according automation programm can be integrated easily. The overall plant model should be implemented in a standard CAD software or in \textit{Unity} as an alternative.
